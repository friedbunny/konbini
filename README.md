# konbini

Living in the snowy wasteland of Toyama, my annual hibernation project for the winter of 2012-13 was to scrape and format as many convenience store locations as I could. Did you know that there is a [Japanese Geodetic Datum](http://www.gsi.go.jp/ENGLISH/page_e30030.html) ([日本測地系](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/測地系#.E6.97.A5.E6.9C.AC.E3.81.AE.E6.B8.AC.E5.9C.B0.E7.B3.BB.EF.BC.9A.E4.B8.96.E7.95.8C.E6.B8.AC.E5.9C.B0.E7.B3.BB.E3.81.A8.E6.97.A5.E6.9C.AC.E6.B8.AC.E5.9C.B0.E7.B3.BB)) that some companies use for web maps? Several datums, in fact! Were to you aware that, despite a façade of techno-prowess, Japan is perpetually 10–15 years behind in most computer and web trends? Oh, the hotdog stand color schemes! And so on and so forth; multitudinous was the minutiae and poor internet citizenship I encountered on the stunted, biting days of that winter.

# use

There's hardly anything here right now — just the raw SQLite database I used for staging, but also a CSV of the bare essentials that one might want to put these shops on a map.

# future

Presumably I'll convert the PHP scrapers I cobbled together back then into something modern and presentable. Or perhaps I'll plop them on here for bitter, ugly posterity. I intend to post logo assets for the konbini included here, especially as I've been lucky enough to find or create vectors for most.

# stats

**47477** konbini were located with reasonable certainty and included in the CSV.
